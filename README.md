# wisselstroom_demo

-  R project to demonstrate the use of  `wisselstroom` package with example script
-  Before you can render the examples, you have to have the package `wisselstroom` installed:  

`devtools::install_github("ed2c/wisselstroom")`

-  The enclosed pdf ( in dutch :) ) is from a workshop in november 2024
-  Demo's are also in dutch
-  Demo's can save a png to file, this as a workaround for issue with html and transparency in ggplots
